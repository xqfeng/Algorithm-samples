283. Move Zeroes
Easy

Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Example:

Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

Note:

    You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
    Minimize the total number of operations.


Analysis & Solution
 To move it in place and minimal operation, we need to iterator all the element. 
 we can set two pointers, one records the zero's position, the other elemnet's position.
 After all elemnts done,  set the position after i as zero.
 
 class Solution {
public:
    void moveZeroes(vector<int>& nums) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        for(; j<nums.size(); j++){
            if(nums[j]!= 0){
                nums[i++] = nums[j];
            }
        }
        for(;i<nums.size(); i++)
            nums[i] = 0;
        return;
    }
};
